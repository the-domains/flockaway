            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>50 of the Best Companies Hiring Remote Workers</h1><p>Meredith Lepore Who actually sits in an office these days?

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why The Buffer Team Goes On Multiple International Retreats Every Year - Open</h1><p>For me, one of the most exciting parts of the culture we've developed at Buffer is our international retreats. Three times a year (for now) we gather the whole company together. Previously, we took a team of 10 to Thailand and we've just returned from our most recent trip to Cape Town, South Africa with a team of 16.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4aed35a545dded78a6bac61e33dd9fa90a3564da.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Buffer Retreat: Why We Spent $111,874 Meeting Face to Face</h1><p>Travel is embedded pretty deeply into Buffer's values-so much so that our entire remote team meets up every 5 months at various spots around the world. Our Buffer retreats are special times for our remote, distributed team to connect in person with one another, with our Buffer audience and with the community of our host city.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/68dd11a759dac32b83b6f0d95446cb144a3eb32e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
